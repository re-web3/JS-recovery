### 1. **Addition (`+`)**

**Explanation:** Adds two numbers together.

**Example:**  
Imagine you have 3 apples, and your friend gives you 2 more. How many apples do you have in total?

```javascript
let apples = 3;
let additionalApples = 2;
let totalApples = apples + additionalApples;
console.log(`Total apples: ${totalApples}`); // Output: Total apples: 5
```

### 2. **Subtraction (`-`)**

**Explanation:** Subtracts one number from another.

**Example:**  
You have 10 candies, and you eat 3. How many candies are left?

```javascript
let candies = 10;
let eatenCandies = 3;
let remainingCandies = candies - eatenCandies;
console.log(`Remaining candies: ${remainingCandies}`); // Output: Remaining candies: 7
```

### 3. **Multiplication (`*`)**

**Explanation:** Multiplies two numbers.

**Example:**  
If one box contains 4 pens, and you have 5 boxes, how many pens do you have in total?

```javascript
let pensInBox = 4;
let numberOfBoxes = 5;
let totalPens = pensInBox * numberOfBoxes;
console.log(`Total pens: ${totalPens}`); // Output: Total pens: 20
```

---

### 4. **Division (`/`)**

**Explanation:** Divides one number by another.

**Example:**  
You have 20 chocolates, and you want to share them equally among 4 friends. How many chocolates does each friend get?

```javascript
let chocolates = 20;
let friends = 4;
let chocolatesPerFriend = chocolates / friends;
console.log(`Chocolates per friend: ${chocolatesPerFriend}`); // Output: Chocolates per friend: 5
```

---

### 5. **Modulus (`%`)**

**Explanation:** Returns the remainder of a division.

**Example:**  
You have 10 marbles, and you want to divide them equally among 3 kids. How many marbles will be left over?

```javascript
let marbles = 10;
let kids = 3;
let leftoverMarbles = marbles % kids;
console.log(`Leftover marbles: ${leftoverMarbles}`); // Output: Leftover marbles: 1
```

---

### 6. **Exponentiation (`**`)\*\*

**Explanation:** Raises the first number to the power of the second number.

**Example:**  
If each branch of a tree splits into 2 smaller branches, and this happens for 3 levels, how many branches will there be?

```javascript
let branchesPerSplit = 2;
let levels = 3;
let totalBranches = branchesPerSplit ** levels;
console.log(`Total branches: ${totalBranches}`); // Output: Total branches: 8
```

---

### 7. **Increment (`++`)**

**Explanation:** Increases a number by 1.

**Example:**  
A player gains 1 point for every successful move.

```javascript
let points = 0;
points++; // Player scores a point
console.log(`Points: ${points}`); // Output: Points: 1
```

---

### 8. **Decrement (`--`)**

**Explanation:** Decreases a number by 1.

**Example:**  
You are counting down the days until your birthday.

```javascript
let daysUntilBirthday = 5;
daysUntilBirthday--; // One day passes
console.log(`Days until birthday: ${daysUntilBirthday}`); // Output: Days until birthday: 4
```
